# Double Union Data Analysis Workshop

http://github.io/alyssackwan/doubleunion-dataanalysis-workshop/

This workshop illustrates how to put together a data analysis and
visualization application from the ground up.  This includes the
use of functional programming with some light discussion of using
multiple concurrent processes.

The following tools are used:

* Clojure programming language (back end)
    * Incanter library (data analysis)
    * Ring and Compojure libraries (web server)
* ClojureScript programming language (front end)
    * D3 library (data visualization)

## Following the Workshop

The git repository has well-defined tags for each intermediate
milestone.  The final product is in the master branch.

You may also check out the website, which has links to step-by-step
instructions.
